# Official-Portfolio

This website is designed to accurately portray my coding capabilities by presenting my projects in a unique and different way. It has different sections for About Me, technical skills, my projects, and links to my Github, Linkedin, and Facebook.

How it works: Sass was used to create the style.css file. A grid, animations and linear-gradients were created and used to make the display cleaner and interactive.
